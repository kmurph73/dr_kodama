Game name: Kodama or Forest Spirits (Kodama is taken)

Crappy [kodama][1] sprites are inspired by Princess Mononoke

Pieces will eventually become orbs.  Will have forest backgrounds and theme I'm thinking.

Pieces rotate counter clockwise.  Tap to rotate.  Not sure what I should have swipe up be yet.
